/**
 * Class used to provide a Java-like interface to Phil Harvey's excellent,
 * Perl-based <a
 * href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool">ExifTool</a>.
 * <p/>
 * There are a number of other basic Java wrappers to ExifTool available online,
 * but most of them only abstract out the actual Java-external-process execution
 * logic and do no additional work to make integration with the external
 * ExifTool any easier or intuitive from the perspective of the Java application
 * written to make use of ExifTool.
 * <p/>
 * This class was written in order to make integration with ExifTool inside of a
 * Java application seamless and performant with the goal being that the
 * developer can treat ExifTool as if it were written in Java, garnering all of
 * the benefits with none of the added headache of managing an external native
 * process from Java.
 * <p/>
 * Phil Harvey's ExifTool is written in Perl and runs on all major platforms
 * (including Windows) so no portability issues are introduced into your
 * application by utilizing this class.
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 * Assuming ExifTool is installed on the host system correctly and either in the
 * system path or pointed to by {@link #EXIF_TOOL_PATH}, using this class to
 * communicate with ExifTool is as simple as creating an instance (
 * <code>ExifTool tool = new ExifTool()</code>) and then making calls to
 * {@link #getImageMeta(File, Tag...)} or
 * {@link #getImageMeta(File, Format, Tag...)} with a list of {@link Tag}s you
 * want to pull values for from the given image.
 * <p/>
 * In this default mode, calls to <code>getImageMeta</code> will automatically
 * start an external ExifTool process to handle the request. After ExifTool has
 * parsed the tag values from the file, the external process exits and this
 * class parses the result before returning it to the caller.
 * <p/>
 * Results from calls to <code>getImageMeta</code> are returned in a {@link Map}
 * with the {@link Tag} values as the keys and {@link String} values for every
 * tag that had a value in the image file as the values. {@link Tag}s with no
 * value found in the image are omitted from the result map.
 * <p/>
 * While each {@link Tag} provides a hint at which format the resulting value
 * for that tag is returned as from ExifTool (see {@link Tag#getType()}), that
 * only applies to values returned with an output format of
 * {@link Format#NUMERIC} and it is ultimately up to the caller to decide how
 * best to parse or convert the returned values.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link Tag} Enum provides the {@link Tag#parseValue(Tag, String)}
 * convenience method for parsing given <code>String</code> values according to
 * the Tag hint automatically for you if that is what you plan on doing,
 * otherwise feel free to handle the return values anyway you want.
 * <h3>ExifTool -stay_open Support</h3>
 * ExifTool <a href=
 * "http://u88.n24.queensu.ca/exiftool/forum/index.php/topic,1402.msg12933.html#msg12933"
 * >8.36</a> added a new persistent-process feature that allows ExifTool to stay
 * running in a daemon mode and continue accepting commands via a file or stdin.
 * <p/>
 * This new mode is controlled via the <code>-stay_open True/False</code>
 * command line argument and in a busy system that is making thousands of calls
 * to ExifTool, can offer speed improvements of up to <strong>60x</strong> (yes,
 * really that much).
 * <p/>
 * This feature was added to ExifTool shortly after user <a
 * href="http://www.christian-etter.de/?p=458">Christian Etter discovered</a>
 * the overhead for starting up a new Perl interpreter each time ExifTool is
 * loaded accounts for roughly <a href=
 * "http://u88.n24.queensu.ca/exiftool/forum/index.php/topic,1402.msg6121.html#msg6121"
 * >98.4% of the total runtime</a>.
 * <p/>
 * Support for using ExifTool in daemon mode is enabled by passing
 * {@link Feature#STAY_OPEN} to the constructor of the class when creating an
 * instance of this class and then simply using the class as you normally would.
 * This class will manage a single ExifTool process running in daemon mode in
 * the background to service all future calls to the class.
 * <p/>
 * Because this feature requires ExifTool 8.36 or later, this class will
 * actually verify support for the feature in the version of ExifTool pointed at
 * by {@link #EXIF_TOOL_PATH} before successfully instantiating the class and
 * will notify you via an {@link UnsupportedFeatureException} if the native
 * ExifTool doesn't support the requested feature.
 * <p/>
 * In the event of an {@link UnsupportedFeatureException}, the caller can either
 * upgrade the native ExifTool upgrade to the version required or simply avoid
 * using that feature to work around the exception.
 * <h3>Automatic Resource Cleanup</h3>
 * When {@link Feature#STAY_OPEN} mode is used, there is the potential for
 * leaking both host OS processes (native 'exiftool' processes) as well as the
 * read/write streams used to communicate with it unless {@link #close()} is
 * called to clean them up when done. <strong>Fortunately</strong>, this class
 * provides an automatic cleanup mechanism that runs, by default, after 10mins
 * of inactivity to clean up those stray resources.
 * <p/>
 * The inactivity period can be controlled by modifying the
 * {@link #PROCESS_CLEANUP_DELAY} system variable. A value of <code>0</code> or
 * less disabled the automatic cleanup process and requires you to cleanup
 * ExifTool instances on your own by calling {@link #close()} manually.
 * <p/>
 * Any class activity by way of calls to <code>getImageMeta</code> will always
 * reset the inactivity timer, so in a busy system the cleanup thread could
 * potentially never run, leaving the original host ExifTool process running
 * forever (which is fine).
 * <p/>
 * This design was chosen to help make using the class and not introducing
 * memory leaks and bugs into your code easier as well as making very inactive
 * instances of this class light weight while not in-use by cleaning up after
 * themselves.
 * <p/>
 * The only overhead incurred when opening the process back up is a 250-500ms
 * lag while launching the VM interpreter again on the first call (depending on
 * host machine speed and load).
 * <h3>Reusing a "closed" ExifTool Instance</h3>
 * If you or the cleanup thread have called {@link #close()} on an instance of
 * this class, cleaning up the host process and read/write streams, the instance
 * of this class can still be safely used. Any followup calls to
 * <code>getImageMeta</code> will simply re-instantiate all the required
 * resources necessary to service the call (honoring any {@link Feature}s set).
 * <p/>
 * This can be handy behavior to be aware of when writing scheduled processing
 * jobs that may wake up every hour and process thousands of pictures then go
 * back to sleep. In order for the process to execute as fast as possible, you
 * would want to use ExifTool in daemon mode (pass {@link Feature#STAY_OPEN} to
 * the constructor of this class) and when done, instead of {@link #close()}-ing
 * the instance of this class and throwing it out, you can keep the reference
 * around and re-use it again when the job executes again an hour later.
 * <h3>Performance</h3>
 * Extra care is taken to ensure minimal object creation or unnecessary CPU
 * overhead while communicating with the external process.
 * <p/>
 * {@link Pattern}s used to split the responses from the process are explicitly
 * compiled and reused, string concatenation is minimized, Tag name lookup is
 * done via a <code>static final</code> {@link Map} shared by all instances and
 * so on.
 * <p/>
 * Additionally, extra care is taken to utilize the most optimal code paths when
 * initiating and using the external process, for example, the
 * {@link ProcessBuilder#command(List)} method is used to avoid the copying of
 * array elements when {@link ProcessBuilder#command(String...)} is used and
 * avoiding the (hidden) use of {@link StringTokenizer} when
 * {@link Runtime#exec(String)} is called.
 * <p/>
 * All of this effort was done to ensure that imgscalr and its supporting
 * classes continue to provide best-of-breed performance and memory utilization
 * in long running/high performance environments (e.g. web applications).
 * <h3>Thread Safety</h3>
 * Instances of this class are <strong>not</strong> Thread-safe. Both the
 * instance of this class and external ExifTool process maintain state specific
 * to the current operation. Use of instances of this class need to be
 * synchronized using an external mechanism or in a highly threaded environment
 * (e.g. web application), instances of this class can be used along with
 * {@link ThreadLocal}s to ensure Thread-safe, highly parallel use.
 * <h3>Why ExifTool?</h3>
 * <a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool">ExifTool</a> is
 * written in Perl and requires an external process call from Java to make use
 * of.
 * <p/>
 * While this would normally preclude a piece of software from inclusion into
 * the imgscalr library (more complex integration), there is no other image
 * metadata piece of software available as robust, complete and well-tested as
 * ExifTool. In addition, ExifTool already runs on all major platforms
 * (including Windows), so there was not a lack of portability introduced by
 * providing an integration for it.
 * <p/>
 * Allowing it to be used from Java is a boon to any Java project that needs the
 * ability to read/write image-metadata from almost <a
 * href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/#supported">any image or
 * video file</a> format.
 * <h3>Alternatives</h3>
 * If integration with an external Perl process is something your app cannot do
 * and you still need image metadata-extraction capability, Drew Noakes has
 * written the 2nd most robust image metadata library I have come across: <a
 * href="http://drewnoakes.com/drewnoakes.com/code/exif/">Metadata Extractor</a>
 * that you might want to look at.

	 * "2.79999992203711" instead of just returning "2.8"). On the other hand,
	 * other values (like Orientation) are easier to parse when their numeric
	 * value (1-8) is returned instead of a much longer friendly name (e.g.
	 * "Mirror horizontal and rotate 270 CW").

	/**
	 * Enum used to pre-define a convenient list of tags that can be easily
	 * extracted from images using this class with an external install of
	 * ExifTool.
	 * <p/>
	 * Each tag defined also includes a type hint for the parsed value
	 * associated with it when the default {@link Format#NUMERIC} value format
	 * is used.
	 * <p/>
	 * All replies from ExifTool are parsed as {@link String}s and using the
	 * type hint from each {@link Tag} can easily be converted to the correct
	 * data format by using the provided {@link Tag#parseValue(Tag, String)}
	 * method.
	 * <p/>
	 * This class does not make an attempt at converting the value automatically
	 * in case the caller decides they would prefer tag values returned in
	 * {@link Format#HUMAN_READABLE} format and to avoid any compatibility
	 * issues with future versions of ExifTool if a tag's return value is
	 * changed. This approach to leaving returned tag values as strings until
	 * the caller decides they want to parse them is a safer and more robust
	 * approach.
	 * <p/>
	 * The types provided by each tag are merely a hint based on the <a
	 * href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/TagNames/index.html"
	 * >ExifTool Tag Guide</a> by Phil Harvey; the caller is free to parse or
	 * process the returned {@link String} values any way they wish.
	 * <h3>Tag Support</h3>
	 * ExifTool is capable of parsing almost every tag known to man (1000+), but
	 * this class makes an attempt at pre-defining a convenient list of the most
	 * common tags for use.
	 * <p/>
	 * This list was determined by looking at the common metadata tag values
	 * written to images by popular mobile devices (iPhone, Android) as well as
	 * cameras like simple point and shoots as well as DSLRs. As an additional
	 * source of input the list of supported/common EXIF formats that Flickr
	 * supports was also reviewed to ensure the most common/useful tags were
	 * being covered here.
	 * <p/>
	 * Please email me or <a
	 * href="https://github.com/thebuzzmedia/imgscalr/issues">file an issue</a>
	 * if you think this list is missing a commonly used tag that should be
	 * added to it.
